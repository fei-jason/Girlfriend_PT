 Dating Life Peaked with ChatGPT

 # Overview 
 Integrated OpenAI API with unity to create a virtual reality chatting experience with an AI personality, called "Rosie." It allows you to talk using your microphone and transcribes into text which is then fed into ChatGPT. Due to how ChatGPT was primed, the experience should simulate a conversation between two people. Responeses return by ChatGPT will be then semantically anaylized by ChatGPT itself to determine the connotation, either positive or negative. The former would increase an intimacy meter, while the latter decreases. This meter is also kept track by ChatGPT and starts off as 10/100. Upon reaching the threshold of 70/100, you should be able to ask Rosie out. You will start off as strangers, though the responses given by Rosie should increase in friendliness as the intimacy meter increases.

# Controls
- L Trigger to record (5 seconds, can be changed)
- Squeeze to send message
- R Trigger to open prompt and start chatting
- HTC Vive trackpad as movement


# Preview
_Note: Will update with better pictures. We didn't think far enough ahead and can't display well without the VR headset._

 # Notes
 All work was done by @ilykeegan, @crewsdel, and myself. The big commits from a stranger were due to misunderstanding on who was signed in at the Computer Lab at UNF.
